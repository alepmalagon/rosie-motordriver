DC Motor Driver
===============

This project is a fork of the Dual DC motor driver compatible with Rosie platform of @PyForce. It includes for the time being just the arduino firmware to use it.

To have up and running this project you will need:
* Arduino UNO (or any other with the ATMega328 microcontroller)
* Osoyoo Balancing Car DC motor(s) with encoder
* Osoyoo Balancing Car Arduino shield


The main features are:
----------------------

* PID speed control
* USB communication protocol
* Low-pass filtering in the encoders signal
